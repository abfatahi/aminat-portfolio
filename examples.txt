<!-- about page -->
<p>
  Hello, I am Oladepo Abdulbaki and I am a front developer and a UI/UX Designer. I live and work in
  somewhere warm. I spend most of my day, experimenting with HTML, CSS and
  JavaScript (and its endless list of frameworks) and FIGMA. I enjoy coding and designing and the
  challenge of learning something new everyday.
